# account
Small accounting thing in Ruby
It's pretty simple and only has a license so if someone wants to change it I can see what they did and maybe learn from it.
I only put it up so I could share it and such. Anyways, Small project I made so I don't need to pay attention so much and
check my account balance as often. 
Oh yea, acmenu.rb is the main way to run although the other three work just fine running themselves, although you will only get
a ledger (last transaction only) by running both option or account.rb. Set the balance.txt to whatever yours is initially as
it's read so it can be updated and the ledger_det.txt is an appended history and funds.txt and expenses.txt are appended records
as well. 

Do whatever you want with it but if you change it please let me know so I can get an idea.
